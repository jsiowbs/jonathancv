    <p> My academic background in management and economics, coupled with practical experience in data and geospatial technology, has positioned me at the intersection of data, technology, and public policy. As issues grow in complexity, my role as a bridge between technology adoption and policymaking, and facilitator of public-private partnerships, has equipped me with a robust understanding of innovation, digital inclusion, and regulation. In particular, I work closely with stakeholders in the urban planning, sustainability, education, and social sectors to develop data-sharing programs for visualization and analytics.</p>
